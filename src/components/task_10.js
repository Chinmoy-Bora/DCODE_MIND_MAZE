            In a quaint town nestled among rolling hills, a heinous crime has
            shaken the community. The victim, a reclusive writer known for
            penning thrilling mysteries, was found lifeless in his study. Only a
            few clues were left behindâ€”a torn page from his latest manuscript, a
            half-empty glass of whiskey, and a faint scent of lavender in the
            air. Amidst whispers of jealousy and hidden motives, can you uncover
            the elusive truth: Who was the last person to see the writer alive?
